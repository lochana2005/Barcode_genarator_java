# Barcode Generator

A simple Java-based barcode generator that allows users to generate and save barcodes using the CODE 128 format. The program uses ZXing (Zebra Crossing) library to generate barcodes and provides a graphical interface for easy interaction.

## Features

- **Barcode Generation**: Enter text and generate a barcode.
- **Barcode Display**: The generated barcode is displayed in a `JLabel`.
- **Save Barcode**: Option to save the generated barcode as an image file (PNG format).

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher
- ZXing Library (https://github.com/zxing/zxing)
- FlatLaf theme for a modern user interface

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lochana2005/Barcode_genarator_java.git
   ```
   
2. **Import into IDE**: 
   - Import the project into your preferred IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc.).

3. **Run the Application**:
   - Execute the `how_to_work` class to launch the graphical interface.

4. **Generate a Barcode**:
   - Enter the desired text in the input field and click the "Generator" button.
   
5. **Save the Barcode**:
   - After generating the barcode, click the "Save Barcode" button to save the barcode image to your preferred location.

## Example Usage

1. Input a string (e.g., `123456789`).
2. Click **"Generate"** to display the barcode.
3. Click **"Save Barcode"** to store the barcode image as `123456789_barcode.png`.

## Code Explanation

- The main functionality is in the `BarcodeGenerator` class, which uses ZXing's `MultiFormatWriter` to generate the barcode and then displays it on a `JLabel`.
- The `how_to_work` class is a GUI that handles user input and interactions, such as generating and saving the barcode.
